# DoodleChamp
Project 2 for Web Development course

# Instructions to run:
Open 2 tabs and go to local host.

Have one tab create a lobby.

Have the second tab enter in the join code and a name to join.

On the host tab check that both players are in the game then click start game.

While in the game the person with the red box around their name has the action to draw and all other players are guessing. 

each player will have 2 rounds of drawing and once everyone has drawn twice the game will show the scoreboard at the end of the game.

To play agian create a new lobby.

# current issues

The score is currently not calculating right. it is being called more than once each round. There are current ideas on how to fix this problem.

The final score board has one extra row that says undefined. Not really sure why this is.

Sometimes players fail to connect to the game after host clicks start game. Not really sure why this is.

if undo is clicked too many times that player will disconnect. Not really sure why this is.

CSS styling is not done. This is really a time issue.

# Future implementations
Make a play again button.

Add accounts.

make the game run smoother.
